# Gatherings #
We will take advantage of the virtual conference environment to meet in the _Platynereis_ community working groups to discuss progress, difficulties and come up with possible solutions. Also, there will be meet-the-speaker-sessions and the possibility to meet virtually in smaller groups. We will be using the gather.town platform for group discussions and social interactions. More information on the gatherings later.
